--- HOW TO USE ---
Running the randomizer:
    Windows users may use the executable file, "ff5gc.exe". Other users, please run "randomizer.py" using Python version 2.7.

Source rom file:
    This randomizer requires either the Japanese version or the RPGe translation of the Final Fantasy 5 rom for SNES. Here are the hashes that were used for testing:
    MD5 - 5245a6ed780d896f416cc8824aa36182 (RPGe)
          d69b2115e17d1cf2cb3590d3f75febb9 (J)

Flags:
    Input the following flags to customize your randomization experience.

    a  Randomize job learned abilities.
    b  Randomize job base commands.
    c  Randomize job outfit colors.
    d  Randomize monster drops and steals.
    i  Randomize item prices.
    l  Randomize spell prices.
    m  Randomize monster stats.
    o  Randomize consumables (without, just gear).
    p  Randomize shops.
    q  Randomize job equippable items.
    s  Randomize job stats.
    t  Randomize treasure.
    y  Randomize jobs obtained from crystal shards.

Seed value:
    Input a seed value here, or leave it blank if you don't care.

Output files:
    The randomizer will output a new, randomized rom with the seed in the filename.

Patches:
    After randommizing, you can run `patcher.py rom-name.smc project-demi.ips` to apply a quality-of-life patch to your ROM.
    You'll probably need to install `python-ips` if you don't have it installed already (`pip3 install python-ips`).
    See `PATCH.md` for more details.
